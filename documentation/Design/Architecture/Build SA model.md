# Developing an architectural model

1. **Start by sketching an outline of the architecture**
  - Map from main requirements and use cases
  - Determine the main components that are needed
  - Choose among the various architectural patterns
    - (Discussed next lecture)
2. **Refine the architecture**
  - Identify how the components will interact and the
interfaces between them
  - Decide how data and functionality will be
distributed among the various components
  - Determine if you can use a framework
    - (Discussed next lecture)
3. **Consider each use case and adjust the architecture
to make it realizable**
4. **Mature the architecture**
  - As you define the final class diagrams and sequence
diagrams
